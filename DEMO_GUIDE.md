# 🎬 GhostPatch Demo Guide

## 🎯 3-Minute Demo Script for Winning

### Opening (0:00-0:20)
**Visual**: GhostPatch logo with lightning animation

**Script**:
> "Ever wanted to combine Python's simplicity with Rust's speed? Or migrate legacy Java to modern TypeScript without rewriting everything? Meet GhostPatch - the Frankenstein code generator that stitches together incompatible languages into working hybrid applications."

**Show**: Homepage with spooky green theme

### Problem Statement (0:20-0:40)
**Visual**: Show statistics or pain points

**Script**:
> "Legacy code is everywhere. Different teams use different languages. Code migration takes weeks and costs thousands. What if you could automatically bridge these languages in minutes?"

**Show**: Examples of different codebases

### Live Demo (0:40-1:40)
**Visual**: Screen recording of GhostPatch in action

**Script**:
> "Watch this. I'll take legacy Java backend code and modern TypeScript frontend code..."

**Actions**:
1. Click "Load Example: Java + TypeScript"
2. Show the code in both editors
3. Click "🔬 Analyze Code"
4. Point out extracted functions: "GhostPatch found 3 functions in Java, 2 in TypeScript"
5. Click "⚡ Stitch Together"
6. Show results: "Bridge type: java-javascript-rest. Generated 4 files including REST API bridge"
7. Expand generated code preview

**Script**:
> "In 10 seconds, GhostPatch analyzed both codebases, identified connection points, and generated a complete REST API bridge with type conversions. This would take a developer 2-3 days manually."

### Kiro Features Tour (1:40-2:10)
**Visual**: Quick tour of .kiro directory

**Script**:
> "GhostPatch was built entirely with Kiro using all five power features:"

**Show**:
1. **Specs** (2 seconds): "4 comprehensive specs defined the stitching rules"
2. **Hooks** (2 seconds): "4 automated hooks streamline the workflow"
3. **Steering** (2 seconds): "3 steering docs ensure consistent spooky messaging"
4. **MCP** (2 seconds): "Custom MCP tools for language detection and AST analysis"
5. **Vibe Coding** (2 seconds): "Rapid iteration for UI and features"

### Real-World Impact (2:10-2:40)
**Visual**: Show statistics and use cases

**Script**:
> "GhostPatch supports 12 programming languages with 10 different bridge types. Real-world applications include:"

**Show examples**:
- "Legacy Java to modern TypeScript - saves 2-3 weeks"
- "C++ performance with Python ML - 100x faster processing"
- "Swift iOS + Kotlin Android - shared business logic"
- "PHP backend + React frontend - seamless integration"

**Script**:
> "Every stitched project includes complete build instructions, type definitions, and production-ready code."

### Call to Action (2:40-3:00)
**Visual**: GitHub repo, live demo link

**Script**:
> "GhostPatch brings dead code back to life. Try it yourself at ghostpatch.dev. Built entirely with Kiro for Kiroween 2025. Star us on GitHub and let us know what languages you want to stitch together next!"

**Show**:
